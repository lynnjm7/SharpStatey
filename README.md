SharpStatey
=================
A small toy project for playing with a Finite State Machine.

## Purpose
The purpose of the this project was to build something that was large enough
to be non-trivial, but small enough to be implemented very quickly, just for the
sake of toying around with some things in C#.

## Design choices
Some of implementation choices of this project (i.e. using interfaces) were made
because I had originally planned to implement a few different kinds of nodes/states
and transitions/edges, in the end I didn't end up implementing those because
they were not necessary for the task. However, the interfaces are still defined
and that is something that I may approach doing at a later time.

## Compilation
This project was tested and works with Mono on my MacBook Pro. I haven't
tested it on any other platforms, but I assume that it should work because I
used pretty standard C# and didn't do anything outlandish.
